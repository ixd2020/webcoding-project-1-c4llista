<p>
  Edward Hopper (July 22, 1882 â€“ May 15, 1967) was an American realist painter and printmaker. 
  <br> While he is widely known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching. 
  <br> Both in his urban and rural scenes, his spare and finely calculated renderings reflected his personal vision of modern American life.
