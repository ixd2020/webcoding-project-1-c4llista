  Jean-Michel Basquiat was a Haitian and Puerto Rican artist of American descent. As part of SAMO, an informal graffiti duo that wrote cryptic epigrams during the late 1970s in the urban hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Basquiat first acquired prominence, where rap, rock, and street art fused into early hip-hop music culture. By the early 1980s, his neo-expressionist paintings were globally displayed in galleries and museums.
